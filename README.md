# Hunger Games

> This is kinda trying to make a game with random fighting like Hunger Games... but this is not a game, it's just a simulation and hopefully can be improved to be better :)

1. install bun: <https://bun.sh/>
   * can be inside wsl
2. install dependencies: `bun install`
3. run game `bun run start:game`
   * `bun run start:game --print-map` can print the map to the console
4. build website `bun run build:website`
5. go to `./apps/visualization/out` to use the static html

> **Note:** I made this for a school assignment, but decided to put it here because it was cool enough :)
